  <h1>Bankruptcy Prediction using Machine Learning</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This project aims to predict bankruptcy using machine learning models on the Taiwan Economic Journal dataset spanning from 1999 to 2009.</p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and outlier removal.</li>
    <li>Utilized various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Neural Network, and Random Forest.</li>
    <li>Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, confusion matrices, and 10-fold cross-validation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Set</h2>
  <p>The dataset contains financial features such as ROA, operating profit, debt ratios, etc., along with a target label indicating bankruptcy status.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>XGBoost, Random Forest, and Neural Network emerged as top-performing models with accuracies around 95-96%.</p>

  <h2>Scope of Improvement</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Real-time prediction implementation.</li>
    <li>Ensemble methods like stacking or blending for improved prediction.</li>
    <li>Addressing class imbalance for better model performance.</li>
    <li>Incorporating domain expertise for more relevant feature selection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning in bankruptcy prediction. Further improvements can enhance the accuracy and applicability of the models.</p>
